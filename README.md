# Example App using Vaadin Charts

Example app used in Vaadin Charts webinar in Feb 2014. Imaginary factory controlling application.

 1. Initially app only reports temperature readings using textual representation
 2. Then we'll add charts for both last weeks readings and real time view
 3. Finally also add a custom theme
 
Tech details:
 
 * Uses Vaadin CDI addon to inject backend directly to views, so deploy to e.g. Glassfish if you want to play with this yourself
 * Backend is just dummy data
 * Also uses Java 8 to emphasis Vaadin Charts is fully forward compatible with Java 8
